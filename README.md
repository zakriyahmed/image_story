# image_story

This project was built to explore Docker and Web App Services (WAS) by creating an AI-powered image recognition mobile app. The app uses Flutter for the Android frontend and a Python backend containerized with Docker, running on AWS EC2. The backend performs object detection using YOLOv5 and serves the results via a REST API.

# Features
- Object detection using ResNet50
- Dockerized backend with FastAPI
- Real-time image processing
- Mobile frontend built with Flutter
- Deployed on AWS EC2

# Learning Goals
- Docker containerization
- Cloud deployment with AWS
- Mobile and backend integration
